# Radio Alert

### **"These go to eleven."**

Send an SMS alert when your favorite band is playing on the radio.

Radio alert polls radio stations using the [Yes API](http://api.yes.com) and sends SMS alerts using the [Twilio API](http://www.twilio.com).

## Why

I really like the radio. These is something special about doing something collectively with thousands of other people. Plus it's really simple.

I also wanted to play with the Twilio and Yes APIs.

## Status

Very beta but works. I wrote this code back when I knew even less than I know now. If I were to mess with this again, I would do many things differently... *c'est la vie*.

## Warning

This script is a bit difficult to kill. Ctrl-C won't do it--you're going to have to kill the process via PID.

## Future

This may be interesting as a simple web app--pick a few artists (or songs) and a few stations and sign up for some alerts.

A shout out to Yes, Twilio, Github and radio stations everywhere!
